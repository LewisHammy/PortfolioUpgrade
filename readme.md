# UpgraePortfolio

This project is an upgrade to my portfolio using react. Due to time, I need to turn in what I have to continue keeping up with the other assignments. I do have the routes set up and the project loads on local device. I plan on using my html and css from my original portfolio, the problem is seperating the code and applying to the apporite folders and files and making sure the routes are correct.
